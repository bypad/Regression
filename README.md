# Linear Regression

OBJECTIVE: Predict the total number of cyclists given the weather.

DATA: Washington DC Bike Share scheme. In particular, we have data from 2011 and 2012, and it captures:
- The date, and some other data around that such as the season (summer, winter, etc), month, day of the week, if it's a workday
- The weather, in terms of the temperature, apparent temperature (i.e. the "feels like" temperature), humidity, windspeed and another categorical that captures the overall "weather type" for the day
- The number of cyclists, broken down into registered and casual users

# Regularised Regression: L1 (Lasso) regression & L2 (ridge) regression

OBJECTIVE: Predict the average travel time for one of your Gympie Road sites in Brisbane

DATA: Travel time data from Brisbane roads. This data contains average travel time over 15 minute intervals along key transport corridors. For simplicity, the data has already been aggregrated into one hour intervals, and all files merged. Each row of our data contains a timestamp that indicates the end of the sampling interval, and a series of values for travel corridors in Brisbane. Each of these values represents the average travel time along that corridor in the past hour.
